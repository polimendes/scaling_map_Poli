<p>We, as scientists and researchers, often take a multi-scale perspective to better understand how natural ecosystems improve people’s lives. These beneficial contributions by ecosystems are called Nature’s contributions to people, NCPs. NCPs can also be called nature’s gifts or ecosystem services.</p>
<p>We are part of <strong><em>ResNet</em></strong>, a network which unites a broad community of scholars, nongovernmental organizations, government agencies, and industry sectors. We work in different regions of Canada, with a common goal of improving how we monitor, model, and manage nature’s contributions to people. In the sections below, together as a subset of members of ResNet, we</p>
<p>(1) discuss the importance of taking a multi-scale perspective,</p>
<p>(2) define what we mean by spatial and temporal scales, and</p>
<p>(3) introduce a few challenges and best practices related to scaling.</p>
<p>As scientists and researchers, we often design studies at different scales, because</p>
<p>(1) decision-makers require data at different spatio-temporal scales,</p>
<p>(2) scientists seek to understand how ecosystem processes and properties vary across scales, and</p>
<p>(3) there are cost and time constraints to collecting data; therefore, we target the scale most relevant for a given question or decision.</p>
