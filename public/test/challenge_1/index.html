		Introduction Predation Different scale(s) are most meaningful for a given decision or research question We design studies at different scales, because
(1) decision-makers require data at different spatio-temporal scales and
(2) scientists seek to understand how ecosystem processes and properties vary across scales.
There are cost and time constraints to collecting data; therefore, we target the scale most relevant for a given question or decision.
*Created by Ágnes Vári. The idea behind this drawing is to start as a decision-maker, researcher, and/or explorer, and show how the view (scale) may change, in a fun way, before we dive into the scientific details.

		Two Nature’s contributions to people: a multi-scale perspective We, as scientists and researchers, often take a multi-scale perspective to better understand how natural ecosystems improve people’s lives. These beneficial contributions by ecosystems are called Nature’s contributions to people, NCPs. NCPs can also be called nature’s gifts or ecosystem services.
We are part of ResNet, a network which unites a broad community of scholars, nongovernmental organizations, government agencies, and industry sectors. We work in different regions of Canada, with a common goal of improving how we monitor, model, and manage nature’s contributions to people.
