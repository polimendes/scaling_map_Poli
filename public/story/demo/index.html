<h3 id="changing-spatial-and-temporal-scales">Changing spatial and temporal scales</h3>
<p>Often data is only available (or can only be collected) at one scale; however, we need information at a different scale to inform a decision or to understand an ecological process. In the figure below we visualize what it means to increase (a) spatial grain size, (b) spatial extent, (c) temporal resolution, and (d) time period.</p>

<h3 id="why-do-we-scale-up-or-down">Why do we scale up or down?</h3>
<p>We may scale up or down for many reasons, including these examples:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>It can be expensive, time-consuming, and dangerous to collect data points in the field at every possible location. Instead, we stratify (e.g., partition) a larger landscape into smaller homogenous areas and take representative samples within each group.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Ecological processes can be difficult to observe directly, including when processes are too fast, too slow, too small, or too large. We develop models to visualize a reality that is inaccessible to our senses.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Management and policy decisions may require data at a different scale (e.g., extent or grain) compared to the scale of available data. For example, we may collect field data about a management intervention at a local scale; however, we may rely on models to test how scaling these interventions could affect outcomes at a larger scale.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>There are many decision-makers at different (nested) spatial scales, with their own mandates, agendas, and actions. Land-use planning policies are often developed considering scales that represent political needs at regional scales, which may or may not be consistent with ecological and societal needs at local scales. For example, climate change mitigation actions at a national scale, may not address heterogeneous needs at finer scales, for example cooling effects at the neighborhood scale.</p>

<h1 id="natures-contributions-to-people-a-multi-scale-perspective">Nature’s contributions to people: a multi-scale perspective</h1>
<p>We, as scientists and researchers, often take a multi-scale perspective to better understand how natural ecosystems improve people’s lives. These beneficial contributions by ecosystems are called Nature’s contributions to people, NCPs. NCPs can also be called nature’s gifts or ecosystem services.</p>
<p>We are part of <strong><em>ResNet</em></strong>, a network which unites a broad community of scholars, nongovernmental organizations, government agencies, and industry sectors. We work in different regions of Canada, with a common goal of improving how we monitor, model, and manage nature’s contributions to people. In the sections below, together as a subset of members of ResNet, we</p>
<p>(1) discuss the importance of taking a multi-scale perspective,</p>
<p>(2) define what we mean by spatial and temporal scales, and</p>
<p>(3) introduce a few challenges and best practices related to scaling.</p>
<p>As scientists and researchers, we often design studies at different scales, because</p>
<p>(1) decision-makers require data at different spatio-temporal scales,</p>
<p>(2) scientists seek to understand how ecosystem processes and properties vary across scales, and</p>

Land-use planning policies are often developed considering scales that represent political needs at regional scales, which may or may not be consistent with ecological and societal needs at local scales. For example, climate change mitigation actions at a national scale, may not address heterogeneous needs at finer scales, for example cooling effects at the neighborhood scale.</p>

<h1 id="spatial-temporal--scale-mismatches">Spatial, temporal, &amp; scale mismatches</h1>
<p>Sometimes, the need for an ecosystem service and the ability of the environment to provide that service don&rsquo;t match up. Here we discuss mismatches
occurring across space, time and scale.</p>
<h2 id="introduction">Introduction</h2>
<p>Sometimes, the need for an ecosystem service (demand) and the ability of the environment to provide that service (supply) don&rsquo;t match up.
No-overlap between supply and demand can occur either in different places (spatial mismatch), at different times (temporal mismatch) or at
different scales (scale mismatch).</p>
<p>For example, some insects, small mammals, and birds contribute to fertilization of plants (that is, to pollination) while they are feeding
and moving among flowers. Pollinators have to move from their nesting places to their feeding sites. Where pollinators originate from in the
landscape is the area of pollination supply. On the other side, demand for pollination occurs where there are plants that need pollination.
When there is a large separation between where pollinators originate from (supply) and where they feed and pollinate (demand), supply and
demand do not match in space.</p>
<h3 id="case-study">Case study</h3>
<p>We&rsquo;ll explore some examples of when demand and supply don&rsquo;t line up using the ecosystem service of pollination as an example. This mismatch
can happen in three main ways:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>Spatial mismatch: If we look at different landscapes, even when there&rsquo;s the same amount of space for pollinators, some farmlands may have
more pollinators simply because their crops are closer to nesting sites. The location and the configuration of nesting sites can influence the
availability of pollinators inside fields. For example, studies in crop fields show that the abundance of pollinators tends to be higher in
smaller crop fields (e.g. 2 ha) than in large ones (e.g. 100 ha). If crop fields&rsquo; edges have suitable places for pollinators to nest, then
pollinators will find it easier to fly to the center of the field and pollinate smaller fields compared to larger fields. The plants in the
center of a large field might be out of reach for some pollinators, given their limited flying range.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Temporal mismatch: Not all pollinators are active at the same time nor during all seasons of crop blooming. Crops may bloom at times that
do not always coincide with all insects’s periods of high activity. As the climate changes, the periods of time when crops bloom and the periods
of time when bees have high activity may no longer align, which may result in greater temporal mismatches.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Scale mismatch: The entire process of pollination needs a specific size and arrangement of the land. One farmer might not have enough land to
establish a nice hedgerow or a flower strip to support the pollinators, or arrange it in the best way for them. But if many farmers work together,
they might be able to create the right conditions for pollinators. This means that encouraging cooperation between farmers might be more successful
than asking one farmer to increase bee-friendly habitats. This is because the size of a single farm might be too small to match the large-scale needs
of the pollination process, and this is an example of scale mismatch.</p>
</li>

<h2 id="best-practices-and-opportunities">Best Practices and Opportunities</h2>
<p>Understand the service area: Think about the whole area that benefits from the ecosystem service, like pollination, and identify who or what benefits from it.
Compare across beneficiaries: Look at different groups or areas that benefit from the service and compare them. This can help identify different needs and how
they might be met.
Identify the benefit gap: Try to figure out where the mismatches between supply and demand are. Where are the needs not being met? Understanding this gap can
help in planning how to fix it.
Think about the arrangement and size of habitat areas: It&rsquo;s not just about how much habitat there is for the pollinators, but also about how this
habitat is arranged. The layout and size of the land can influence how well it supports the pollinators and provides the needed service.</p>
<p>By considering these points, we can better understand how to manage and support many ecosystem services like pollination. It helps in creating a plan that fits
the specific needs of the area and the people who depend on these services.</p>
